# DEPRECATED FILE
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains outdated logic and has been replaced by the modular
# components in the `core` and `cli` directories.
#
# DO NOT USE OR RUN THIS FILE.
#
# The main entry points for the application are:
# - For command-line interface: `python -m gunbot_quant.cli.main`
# - For API: `uvicorn gunbot_quant.api.main:app`
#
# This file is retained for historical purposes only and will be removed in a
# future version. Running it will result in incorrect, bloated reports and
# will not work with the new user interface.
